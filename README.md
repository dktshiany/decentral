Decentral Front End Challenge
Goal:
- The goal of this challenge is to simulate real work at Decentral. During a typical day, a
Front End Developer is expected to:
- Interact with various APIâ€™s
- Create Angular Components and Views based on this data
- Optimize load times of components
- Write efficient algorithms for interacting with data
- Write tests for all their work
Challenge:
- Using the public Bittrex API, create a web application using your favourite framework that
displays the market summary for all supported trading pairs.
- Allow the user to search for a particular trading pair. Eg. BTC-LTC
- Give the user an option to sort the pairs by percentage gain / loss per day. Percentage gain
can be calculated by (Last - PrevDay) / PrevDay. Please implement your own sorting
algorithm.
